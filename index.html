            I was born and raised in Taos, New Mexico with my parents and <br>two older sisters.
            I have lived in Colorado, on and off for about 13 years. I <em>love</em> to travel,
            I've lived abroad a few times and am always itching to get back on the road. I also love to bake,
            so much that I even owned my own pie company! I have a passion for art, great food, and yoga. At
            the end of the day, I'm a curious individual who loves to explore and learn more about everything.
            </p>
