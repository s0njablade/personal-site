      <h3>"You're Quitting Your Job?"</h3>

          <p>This was the common reaction I received when telling my friends and family that I had decided to take a leap and change my career.
            Truth be told, I have been wanting to find a new career path for a couple of years now. I have been working in marketing for a little
          over 6 years, and I just wasn't enjoying it anymore. I am someone who loves to learn, to be challenged, to create things, and I found myself less than satisfied with my current career. Long story short, I was bored!

            I tried out a few different things: I owned my own business, I did some freelance writing, but neither of those felt "right".
            I have some friends that have taken courses at Galvanize and after hearing about their experiences and success after the program,
            I decided to look into it. I have worked with HTML and CSS in the past, and I have always been intrigued, but I honestly thought
            it wasn't for me.

            That said, the more I played around and spoke with my friends in the industry, I started to realize just how off-base that assumption was.
            So, I quit my job, am holding my breath, and I am ready to do something new. I am excited to be back in a learning environment
            and cannot wait to fully dive in. I have enjoyed the process thus far and I feel as though my brain is waking up!
            Upon completing this program, I hope to join a growing company with a great team. I am not sure what my ideal situation
            will look like, but I am open to any opportunities that come my way!
